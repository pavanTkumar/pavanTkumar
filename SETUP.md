# GitHub Profile + CV — Quick Setup

1) **Create your profile repo**  
   - Go to GitHub → New repository  
   - Name it exactly your username, e.g. `pavankumar` → it becomes `github.com/pavankumar/pavankumar`  
   - Make it **Public**

2) **Upload these files**  
   - Put `README.md` at the root (this makes your Profile appear on your GitHub home)  
   - Put everything in `docs/` and `assets/` as-is (for your web CV and PDF)

3) **Enable GitHub Pages**  
   - Repo Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → **Deploy from a branch**  
   - Branch: `main` · Folder: `/docs` → Save  
   - Your web CV will be at `https://<your-username>.github.io/`

4) **Pin your best repos**  
   - On your GitHub profile, click **Customize your pins** → add your top 6 projects

5) **Keep your PDF fresh**  
   - Replace the file in `assets/` with your latest resume, keep the same filename to avoid link rot.

Tips
- Use short, proof-based bullets in README. Link to live demos.
- Add a “Now” section or “What I’m building” in README to show momentum.
- Keep your pinned repos deployed and documented.
